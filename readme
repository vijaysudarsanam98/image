Login: In one api a user can sign in & signup, both the cases the bearer token generated.
        This is used as Oauth , in which Google sign in can be  done on Client end.

        Image Api: The image Contains Routes Post,Get & Delete.
                    Put is Avoided because there would not be any use.
                    Multer is used to uplaod the image


                    Share Api is avoided because it would be more easier to use on cleint side , because we need to use raabitmq.

Application to run:node server
Unit test is avoided since only login can be done.
